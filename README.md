🌸 Iris Species Classification & AutoML Benchmark📌 Project OverviewThis project implements a comprehensive machine learning workflow to classify Iris flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on their sepal and petal measurements.The notebook moves beyond simple modeling by incorporating Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), robust preprocessing, and a performance comparison using both traditional manual modeling and AutoML (LazyPredict) to find the best performing algorithms.📂 DatasetThe project uses the classic Iris Dataset.Total Instances: 150 (50 per class)Features:Sepal Length (cm)Sepal Width (cm)Petal Length (cm)Petal Width (cm)Target: Species (Encoded as 0, 1, 2)🛠️ Workflow & MethodologyThe notebook follows a structured data science pipeline:1. Data Exploration & VisualizationLoaded dataset and checked for structural integrity.Analyzed statistical descriptions (describe()) and class balance (value_counts()).Visualization: Utilized Seaborn for Pairplots to observe feature correlations and separability, and Scatterplots to visualize clusters.2. Data PreprocessingCleaning: Removed irrelevant columns (e.g., Id).Encoding: Transformed categorical target labels (Species) into numerical format using LabelEncoder.Splitting: Divided data into training and testing sets (75% Train / 25% Test).Scaling: Applied StandardScaler to normalize feature distributions, which is crucial for algorithms like SVC and Gaussian Naive Bayes.3. Model ImplementationThree specific classifiers were manually trained and evaluated:Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)Logistic RegressionSupport Vector Classifier (SVC - RBF Kernel)4. AutoML Benchmark (LazyPredict)Implemented LazyPredict to automatically run and evaluate over 25+ classification models simultaneously without parameter tuning.This helped establish a baseline and confirm that simpler models (like GaussianNB) perform exceptionally well on this dataset.📊 Model Performance ResultsDue to the clean nature of the dataset and proper preprocessing (Scaling), the models achieved high accuracy.ModelAccuracyPrecisionRecallF1-ScoreGaussian Naive Bayes100%1.001.001.00Logistic Regression100%1.001.001.00SVC (RBF Kernel)97%0.980.970.97Note: The high accuracy indicates that the classes (especially Setosa) are linearly separable or highly distinct in the feature space.🚀 Installation & UsageClone the repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/yourusername/iris-classification.git
